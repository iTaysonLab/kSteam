## r32

*Literally everything here is changed, more like a rewrite from scratch, leaving ~25% of original codebase*

- **[breaking change]** massive persistence rework, saved storage from earlier kSteam versions IS NOT COMPATIBLE (including Steam Guard)
- re-enable support for macOS/iOS compilation
- **[breaking change]** massive rework of extension architecture, simplifying everything to "core"-"implementation" model
- **[breaking change]** introduce `core-persistence` for managing saved user data
- `core/unifiedmessages`: provide a custom Wire client implementation for simplifying API requests
- **[breaking change]** `core/account`: now uses secure persistence
- `extension-client`: introduce Realm Mobile Database for persisting personas, collections, game metadata  
- `extension-client/persona`: optimize flows by using Realm queries
- **[breaking change]** `extension-client/pics`: key-value DB is not required anymore
- **[breaking change]** `extension-client/pics`: massive rework of querying, caching and storing to minimize extra requests
- `extension-client/guard`: now uses secure persistence

## r31

---

- **[breaking change]** Disable support for macOS/iOS compilation, effectively making kSteam a JVM/Android-only library
- **[breaking change]** RPC calls now use Wire's gRPC custom client implementation instead of manually passing request/response adapters. This also enables usage of Steam-defined services directly.
- `extension-pics`: support for 64-bit app IDs, making the client not crashing if providing folders with non-Steam applications 
- update dependencies
- streamline the version updating procedure by introducing version catalogs
- synchronized protobufs with the latest provided by Steam

## r30

---

- Matches Cobalt `1.0-prototype` build

## r29

- `extension-core/news`: implement `getUpcomingEvents` and `getUpcomingEvents`
- `extension-core/news`: extract friend activity to `UserNews` handler
- `extension-core/news`: rework `ActivityFeedEntry` to be more UI-compliant
- `extension-core/news`: other fixes and improvements
- `core/webapi`: reworked API wrappers to be more modern and Kotlin-friendly

- streamline build process
- provide `android` artifacts as well, with Compose stability bindings and logcat output

## r28

---

- `core`: introduce `extractAccountIdFromSteam` and `toSteamId` extensions for `Long` and `Int`

## r27

---

- **[breaking change]** `extension-pics`: fixed JSON exception when Steam can give absolutely random order values for collections (`Int` -> `Double`)

## r26

---
